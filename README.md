### Week-5-ELMP DATABASE WEEK! 

---

# FAC Fortunes and Cookies 

This week we aimed to learn about databases, specifically SQL, as well as advancing our Node knowledge.

- Designing and documenting a database schema
- Create a relational database
- Read and write SQL queries 
- Avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Handle node errors 
- Testing SQL and servers 

We used all this database and node wizardry to create a page where FAC20 submit their own quotes and wisdom, and receive a cookie containing the wisdom of others!

## If you want to install locally rather than using the heroku link 

- Git clone this repo
- Run `npm install` to set up node modules
-- enter `psql`
-- `CREATE USER myuser SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'mypassword';`
-- `CREATE DATABASE learn_node_postgres WITH OWNER myuser;`
- Create .env file in project
- Add `DATABASE_URL` variable in your .env file and assign to initialised database
- `npm run start` will start the server 


### For the tests -- 

`npm run test` 


## Our team 

- Amber : quality  üïµ
- Shaya : design üë©‚Äçüé®
- Terrence : deployment  üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Trish : facilitator  üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


## Our user stories 

- As a visually impaired user I would like to be able to navigate the page
- As a user, I want to submit my own and other people's pearls of wisdom and check-in question answers for the rest of FAC to read
- As a user, I want to come back later to read our responses as 'fortunes' 
- As a user, I want to know how to use the fortune cookie site and what it's for
- Stretch goal: As a FAC20 member, I want to search through the wisdom of my cohort for specific people's answers
